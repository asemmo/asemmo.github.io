  abstract   = { We present a photo-editing method that enables per-pixel parameter manipulation of image filtering by means of interactive painting. Predefined as well as custom image filters are exposed to the user, as a parametrizable composition of image operations. Brushes, as a sequences of actions mapping user inputs (in terms of brush shape, flow, pressure, etc.) to arbitrary functions or convolution operators, are used to draw within the parameter space. Our tool demonstrates that interactive painting can be used to, e.g., locally tweak inadequate parametrization and, furthermore, provides a blueprint for an open, collaborative photo-editing platform. },
