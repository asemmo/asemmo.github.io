    "caption"   : "In this work we present new weighting functions for the anisotropic Kuwahara filter. The anisotropic Kuwahara filter is an edge-preserving filter that is especially useful for creating stylized abstractions from images or videos. It is based on a generalization of the Kuwahara filter that is adapted to the local shape of features. For the smoothing process, the anisotropic Kuwahara filter uses weighting functions that use convolution in their definition. For an efficient implementation, these weighting functions are therefore usually sampled into a texture map. By contrast, our new weighting functions do not require convolution and can be efficiently computed directly during the filtering in real-time. We show that our approach creates output of similar quality as the original anisotropic Kuwahara filter and present an evaluation scheme to compute the new weighting functions efficiently by using rotational symmetries.",

    "caption"   : "Aerial images represent a fundamental type of geodata with a broad range of applications in GIS and geovisualization. The perception and cognitive processing of aerial images by the human, however, still is faced with the specific limitations of photorealistic depictions such as low contrast areas, unsharp object borders as well as visual noise. In this paper we present a novel technique to automatically abstract aerial images that enhances visual clarity and generalizes the contents of aerial images to improve their perception and recognition. The technique applies non-photorealistic image processing by smoothing local image regions with low contrast and emphasizing edges in image regions with high contrast. To handle the abstraction of large images, we introduce an image tiling procedure that is optimized for post-processing images on GPUs and avoids visible artifacts across junctions. This is technically achieved by filtering additional connection tiles that overlap the main tiles of the input image. The technique also allows the generation of different levels of abstraction for aerial images by computing a mipmap pyramid, where each of the mipmap levels is filtered with adapted abstraction parameters. These mipmaps can then be used to perform level-of-detail rendering of abstracted aerial images. Finally, the paper contributes a study to aerial image abstraction by analyzing the results of the abstraction process on distinctive visible elements in common aerial image types. In particular, we have identified a high abstraction straction potential in landscape images and a higher benefit from edge enhancement in urban environments.",

Sie präsentieren eine spezialisierte Form geovirtueller Umgebungen und sind gekennzeichnet durch ein zugrunde liegendes 3D-Geländemodell, einer darin befindlichen 3D-Bebauung sowie des dazu komplementären Straßen-, Grünflächen- und Naturraumes. 3D-Stadtmodell-Systeme ermöglichen es dem Nutzer, sich im Modell interaktiv zu bewegen und sie stellen die Grundfunktionen für die Exploration, Analyse, Präsentation und das Editieren der raumbezogenen Information bereit. Besonders im Gebiet der kartenähnlichen und kartenverwandten 3D-Darstellungen stellen u.a. automatische Verfahren und Techniken zur Stilisierung und Abstraktion von Objekten eines 3D Stadtmodell ein Hauptproblem für die interaktive 3D-Bildsynthese dar. Hier spielt insbesondere die Abstraktion und Illustration potentiell wichtiger Information und somit die Reduzierung der kognitiven Belastung des Nutzers eine tragende Rolle. Diesbezüglich sind Verfahren und Techniken zur nicht-photorealistischen Bildsynthese ein bewährtes Mittel der Computergrafik, deren direkte Anwendung auf ein komplettes 3D-Stadtmodell jedoch häufig monotone sowie gestalterisch und kartographisch stark eingeschränkte Resultate liefert. Eine effiziente und kontextsensitive Kommunikation von 3D-Geoinformation bedarf jedoch der Kopplung von Objektsemantik und Abstraktionsverfahren. Diese Arbeit präsentiert ein Konzept und dessen Umsetzung, das die Auswahl und Parametrisierung von nicht-photorealistischen Darstellungstechniken auf Basis von Objektsemantiken erlaubt (Abbildung 1). Dies ermöglicht die Zuweisung unterschiedlicher automatischer Abstraktionstechniken zu Objekten und Objektgruppen.

To date, most 3D city models are visualized using photorealistic graphics. But an effective communication of geoinformation significantly depends on how important information is designed and cognitively processed in the given application context. One possibility to visually emphasize important information is based on non-photorealistic rendering, which comprehends artistic depiction styles and is characterized by its expressiveness and communication aspects. However, a direct application of non-photorealistic rendering techniques primarily results in monotonic visualization that lacks cartographic design aspects. In this work, we present concepts for cartography-oriented visualization of virtual 3D city models. These are based on coupling non-photorealistic rendering techniques and semantics-based information for a user, context, and media-dependent representation of thematic information. This work highlights challenges for cartography-oriented visualization of 3D geovirtual environments, presents stylization techniques and discusses their applications and ideas for a standardized visualization. In particular, the presented concepts enable a real-time and dynamic visualization of thematic geoinformation.",

      "caption"   : "Texture mapping is a key technology in computer graphics for visual design of rendered 3D scenes. An effective information transfer of surface properties, encoded by textures, however, depends significantly on how important information is highlighted and cognitively processed by the user in an application context. Edge-preserving image filtering is a promising approach to address this concern while preserving global salient structures. Much research has focused on applying image filters in a post-process stage to foster an artistically stylized rendering, but these approaches are generally not able to preserve depth cues important for 3D visualization (e.g., texture gradient). To this end, filtering that processes texture data coherently with respect to linear perspective and spatial relationships is required. In this work, we present a system that enables to process textured 3D scenes with perspective coherence by arbitrary image filters. We propose decoupled deferred texturing with (1) caching strategies to interactively perform image filtering prior to texture mapping, and (2) for each mipmap level separately to enable a progressive level of abstraction. We demonstrate the potentials of our methods on several applications, including illustrative visualization, focus+context visualization, geometric detail removal, and depth of field. Our system supports frame-to-frame coherence, order-independent transparency, multitexturing, and content-based filtering.",

Today, these environments are often visualized using static graphical variants (e.g., 2D maps, 3D photorealistic) from which a user is able to choose from. To serve the different interests of users in specific information, however, the spatial and thematic granularity at which model contents are represented (i.e., level of abstraction) should be dynamically adapted to the user's context, which requires specialized interaction techniques for parameterization. In this work, we present a framework that enables interaction interfaces to parameterize the level-of-abstraction visualization according to spatial, semantic, and thematic data. The framework is implemented in a visualization system that provides image-based rendering techniques for context-aware abstraction and highlighting. Using touch and natural language interfaces, we demonstrate its versatile application to geospatial tasks, including exploration, navigation, and orientation.",

First, dominant feature-aware colors are derived from the input image via entropy-based metrics. Seed pixels are then determined and propagated to the remaining pixels by adopting the optimization framework of Levin et al. [2004] for feature-aware colorization. Finally, the quantized output is combined with flow-based highlights and contour lines to simulate paint texture. Our technique leads to homogeneous outputs in the color domain and enables interactive control over color definitions.",

Their key element, a multi-perspective view, seamlessly combines what is seen from multiple viewpoints into a single image. This approach facilitates thepresentation of information for virtual 3D city and landscape models, particularly by reducing occlusions, increasing screen-space utilization, and providing additional context within a single image. We complement multi-perspective views with cartographic visualization techniques to stylize features according to their semantics and highlight important or prioritized information. When combined, both techniques constitute the core implementation of interactive, multi-perspective 3D panoramas. They offer a large number of effective means for visual communication of 3D spatial information, a high degree of customization with respect to cartographic design, and manifold applications in different domains. We discuss design decisions of 3D panoramas for the exploration of and navigation in 3D GeoVEs. We also discuss a preliminary user study that indicates that 3D panoramas are a promising approach for navigation systems using 3D GeoVEs.",

      "caption"   : "Transportation networks, such as streets, railroads or metro systems, constitute primary elements in cartography for reckoning and navigation. In recent years, they have become an increasingly important part of 3D virtual environments for the interactive analysis and communication of complex hierarchical information, for example in routing, logistics optimization, and disaster management. A variety of rendering techniques have been proposed that deal with integrating transportation networks within these environments, but have so far neglected the many challenges of an interactive design process to adapt their spatial and thematic granularity (i.e., level-of-detail and level-of-abstraction) according to a user's context. This paper presents an efficient real-time rendering technique for the view-dependent rendering of geometrically complex transportation networks within 3D virtual environments. Our technique is based on distance fields using deferred texturing that shifts the design process to the shading stage for real-time stylization. We demonstrate and discuss our approach by means of street networks using cartographic design principles for context-aware stylization, including view-dependent scaling for clutter reduction, contour-lining to provide figure-ground, handling of street crossings via shading-based blending, and task-dependent colorization. Finally, we present potential usage scenarios and applications together with a performance evaluation of our implementation.",

      "caption"   : "Texture mapping is a key technology in computer graphics. For the visual design of 3D scenes, in particular, effective texturing depends significantly on how important contents are expressed, e.g., by preserving global salient structures, and how their depiction is cognitively processed by the user in an application context. Edge-preserving image filtering is one key approach to address these concerns. Much research has focused on applying image filters in a post-process stage to generate artistically stylized depictions. However, these approaches generally do not preserve depth cues, which are important for the perception of 3D visualization (e.g., texture gradient). To this end, filtering is required that processes texture data coherently with respect to linear perspective and spatial relationships. In this work, we present an approach for texturing 3D scenes with perspective coherence by arbitrary image filters. We propose decoupled deferred texturing with (1) caching strategies to interactively perform image filtering prior to texture mapping and (2) for each mipmap level separately to enable a progressive level of abstraction, using (3) direct interaction interfaces to parameterize the visualization according to spatial, semantic, and thematic data. We demonstrate the potentials of our method by several applications using touch or natural language inputs to serve the different interests of users in specific information, including illustrative visualization, focus+context visualization, geometric detail removal, and semantic depth of field. The approach supports frame-to-frame coherence, order-independent transparency, multitexturing, and content-based filtering. In addition, it seamlessly integrates into real-time rendering pipelines, and is extensible for custom interaction techniques.",
