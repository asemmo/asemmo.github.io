    "caption"   : "In this work we present new weighting functions for the anisotropic Kuwahara filter. The anisotropic Kuwahara filter is an edge-preserving filter that is especially useful for creating stylized abstractions from images or videos. It is based on a generalization of the Kuwahara filter that is adapted to the local shape of features. For the smoothing process, the anisotropic Kuwahara filter uses weighting functions that use convolution in their definition. For an efficient implementation, these weighting functions are therefore usually sampled into a texture map. By contrast, our new weighting functions do not require convolution and can be efficiently computed directly during the filtering in real-time. We show that our approach creates output of similar quality as the original anisotropic Kuwahara filter and present an evaluation scheme to compute the new weighting functions efficiently by using rotational symmetries.",

    "caption"   : "Behavioral variations are central to modern computer games as they are making the gameplay a more interesting user experience. However, these variations significantly add to the implementation complexity. We discuss the domain of computer games with respect to dynamic behavioral variations and argue that context-oriented programming is of special interest for this domain. This motivates our extension to the dynamic scripting language Lua, which is frequently used in the development of computer games. Our newly provided programming constructs allow game developers to use layers for defining and activating variations of the basic gameplay.",

    "caption"   : "The communication of cultural heritage in public spaces such as museums or exhibitions, gain more and more importance during the last years. The possibilities of interactive 3D applications open a new degree of freedom beyond the mere presentation of static visualizations, such as pre-produced video or image data. A user is now able to directly interact with 3D virtual environments that enable the depiction and exploration of digital cultural heritage artefacts in real-time. However, such technology requires concepts and strategies for guiding a user throughout these scenarios, since varying levels of experiences within interactive media can be assumed. This paper presents a concept as well as implementation for communication of digital cultural heritage in public spaces, by example of the project Roman Cologne. It describes the results achieved by an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists, designers, and computer graphics engineers with the aim to virtually reconstruct an interactive high-detail 3D city model of Roman Cologne.",

    "caption"   : "Aerial images represent a fundamental type of geodata with a broad range of applications in GIS and geovisualization. The perception and cognitive processing of aerial images by the human, however, still is faced with the specific limitations of photorealistic depictions such as low contrast areas, unsharp object borders as well as visual noise. In this paper we present a novel technique to automatically abstract aerial images that enhances visual clarity and generalizes the contents of aerial images to improve their perception and recognition. The technique applies non-photorealistic image processing by smoothing local image regions with low contrast and emphasizing edges in image regions with high contrast. To handle the abstraction of large images, we introduce an image tiling procedure that is optimized for post-processing images on GPUs and avoids visible artifacts across junctions. This is technically achieved by filtering additional connection tiles that overlap the main tiles of the input image. The technique also allows the generation of different levels of abstraction for aerial images by computing a mipmap pyramid, where each of the mipmap levels is filtered with adapted abstraction parameters. These mipmaps can then be used to perform level-of-detail rendering of abstracted aerial images. Finally, the paper contributes a study to aerial image abstraction by analyzing the results of the abstraction process on distinctive visible elements in common aerial image types. In particular, we have identified a high abstraction straction potential in landscape images and a higher benefit from edge enhancement in urban environments.",
